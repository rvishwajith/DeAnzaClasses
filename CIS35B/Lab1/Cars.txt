The data that stores car information to be parswed by the driver class. There is a "|" in front of every line that contains data so that any type of basic markup text, like this one is supported without difficulty. Spaces are always ignored when parsing data. This is intended to be easy to scale provided that all lengths are defined, similar to how lengths are defined in the POJO building example. Length is always the first line.

CONDITIONS:
Length is aways the first line
The length of any array is always defined before any elements are added to it.
